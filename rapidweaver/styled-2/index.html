With her help I was able to identify but correct and grow key development issues with my staff. The coaching she has provided on an individual basis has given valuable insight and helped to recognise where I can improve myself and my staff. The skills and concepts I learned will be invaluable for the rest of my career.&rdquo;</span><span style="font:12px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#404040;"><br />K B<br /></span><span style="font:12px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight:bold; color:#151515;font-weight:bold; "><br /><br />&ldquo;I absolutely love my coaching sessions with Clare. I have not worked with a coach before so didn&rsquo;t know what to expect. I have been inspired to make change and appreciate coming away from each session with simple, easy steps &ndash; which I have designed &ndash; to make things happen for me.
Having three young children I thought my life situation would be to mundane for coaching however Clare is able to walk me through what I can do to take control of where I want to be. She is very motivational, a great listener and is really helping me to make changes which are ongoing.&rdquo;</span><span style="font:12px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#404040;"><br />O B<br /></span><span style="font:12px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight:bold; color:#151515;font-weight:bold; "><br /><br />&ldquo;Extremely helpful sessions. It has been great to have the time to discuss my issues and work on actions. I have found Clare to be a skilled listener, intuitive and wise. I trust her professionalism and have felt very comfortable. This has been a very good experience and I leave feeling inspired to change some previous thinking and behaviours. I am excited to get on with it.&rdquo;<br /></span><span style="font:12px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#151515;">G M</span><span style="font:12px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#404040;"><br /></span><span style="font:12px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight:bold; color:#151515;font-weight:bold; "><br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad I got the opportunity to meet Clare through a friend. I have had a considerable amount of life challenges in the last 14 months. These have placed an enormous amount of stress in my life, taking its toll on my health and wellbeing. Since working with Clare she has helped enormously to work through a whole maze of issues and get some clarity and direction back into my life.&rdquo;</span><span style="font:12px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#404040;"><br />NT<br /></span>
